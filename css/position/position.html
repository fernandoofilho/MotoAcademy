            to
            ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying
            through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when
            our
            power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is
            to
            be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations
            of
            business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man
            therefore
            always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater
            pleasures, or
            else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.
